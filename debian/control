Description: Jenkins CI core Java libraries
 Jenkins monitors executions of repeated jobs, such as building a software
 project or jobs run by cron. Among those things, current Jenkins focuses
 on the following two jobs:
 .
  * Building/testing software projects continuously, just like CruiseControl
    or DamageControl. In a nutshell, Jenkins provides an easy-to-use
    so-called continuous integration system, making it easier for developers
    to integrate changes to the project, and making it easier for users to
    obtain a fresh build. The automated, continuous build increases
    productivity.
  * Monitoring executions of externally-run jobs, such as cron jobs and
    procmail jobs, even those that are run on a remote machine. For example,
    with cron, all you receive is regular e-mails that capture the output,
    and it is up to you to look at them diligently and notice when it broke.
    Jenkins keeps those outputs and makes it easy for you to notice when
    something is wrong.
 .
 This package contains the core libraries that are used by Jenkins.
 These are useful when building other components such as plugins.

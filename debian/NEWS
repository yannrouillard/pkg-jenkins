  have been packaged for Debian.

jenkins (1.409.3+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This release of jenkins for Debian makes some changes to the way that
  the upstart configuration files work when built for Ubuntu; specifically 
  all environment variable changes should now be made in /etc/default/jenkins
  and /etc/default/jenkins-slave rather than using upstart override files.

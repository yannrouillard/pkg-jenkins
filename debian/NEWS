jenkins (1.409.3+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This release of jenkins for Debian makes some changes to the way that
    the upstart configuration files work when built for Ubuntu; specifically 
    all environment variable changes should now be made in /etc/default/jenkins
    and /etc/default/jenkins-slave rather than using upstart override files.

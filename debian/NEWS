jenkins (1.480.3+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Jenkins will by default listen on 127.0.0.1 to ensure that Jenkins
  installations can be secured prior to wider access.

  See https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Securing+Jenkins for
  more details on how to secure Jenkins.

jenkins (1.480.2+dfsg-1~exp1) experimental; urgency=low

  This new version of Jenkins will generate a new set of different
  cryptographic keys to protect sensitive data, authenticate slaves,
  and so on.

  Because of this, administrators of Jenkins need to be aware of
  the following implications of the upgrade:

   API tokens of many users will likely change as a result, and
   therefore if you have scripts and external programs that rely
   on these tokens, some of them will fail. Please retrieve the
   updated API tokens from the UI.

   Slaves that are started via Java Web Start will fail to reconnect
   if the *.jnlp file is locally stored. This is because the
   authentication tokens change. An administrator would have to
   login to the UI, retrieve the *.jnlp file and overwrite what's
   already on the slave. A slave that was launched via Java Web Start
   and then turned into a service through its menu falls into this
   category.

   Once the new version is started, the administrator needs to run
   the Re-keying process to update the on-disk configuration files
   to use the newer encryption key. Go to "Manage Jenkins" page and
   follow the instruction at the top of the page. Please also read
   https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/SECURITY/Re-keying before
   running this process.

  See https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/SECURITY/Jenkins+Security+Advisory+2013-01-04 
  for more details of the security vulnerability.

jenkins (1.447.1+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This new upstream release of Jenkins does not currently include
  the new sshd (Jenkins as a SSH server) feature. 

  This will be added at a late date once this module and its dependencies
  have been packaged for Debian.

jenkins (1.409.3+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This release of jenkins for Debian makes some changes to the way that
  the upstart configuration files work when built for Ubuntu; specifically 
  all environment variable changes should now be made in /etc/default/jenkins
  and /etc/default/jenkins-slave rather than using upstart override files.

jenkins (1.409.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

 * This release of jenkins for Debian makes some changes to the way that
   the upstart configuration files work when built for Ubuntu; specifically 
   all environment variable changes should now be made in /etc/default/jenkins
   and /etc/default/jenkins-slave rather than using upstart override files.

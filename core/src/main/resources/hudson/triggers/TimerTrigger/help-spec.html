<div>
  This field follows the syntax of cron (with minor differences).
  Specifically, each line consists of 5 fields separated by TAB or whitespace:
  <pre>MINUTE HOUR DOM MONTH DOW</pre>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>MINUTE</td>
      <td>Minutes within the hour (0-59)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>HOUR</td>
      <td>The hour of the day (0-23)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>DOM</td>
      <td>The day of the month (1-31)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>MONTH</td>
      <td>The month (1-12)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>DOW</td>
      <td>The day of the week (0-7) where 0 and 7 are Sunday.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
    To specify multiple values for one field, the following operators are
    available. In the order of precedence,
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>'*' can be used to specify all valid values.</li>
    <li>'M-N' can be used to specify a range, such as "1-5"</li>
    <li>'M-N/X' or '*/X' can be used to specify skips of X's value through the range,
        such as "*/15" in the MINUTE field for "0,15,30,45" and "1-6/2" for "1,3,5"</li>
    <li>'A,B,...,Z' can be used to specify multiple values, such as "0,30" or "1,3,5"</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To allow periodically scheduled tasks to produce even load on the system,
    the '<tt>H</tt>' token can be used. For example, people often use
    '<tt>0 0 * * *</tt>' for a daily job, but this ends up causing a large
    spike in midnight. In contrast, doing '<tt>H H * * *</tt>' would
    still execute a job once a day, but the actual time of the day this gets
    executed will be spread over by Jenkins.
  </p><p>
    The 'H' token can be used with a range. For example, '<tt>H H(0-7) * * *</tt>'
    means some time between midnight to 7:59am.
  </p><p>
    The '<tt>H</tt>' token can be thought of as a random value over a range,
    but it actually is a hash of the job name, not a random function, so that
    the value remains stable for any given project.
  </p>
  <p>
    Empty lines and lines that start with '#' will be ignored as comments.
  </p><p>
    In addition, '@yearly', '@annually', '@monthly', '@weekly', '@daily', '@midnight',
    and '@hourly' are supported.

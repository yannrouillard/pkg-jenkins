<div>
    Specify where Jenkins would store records of the past builds.
    This value can include the following variables.

    <ul>
        <li><tt>${JENKINS_HOME}</tt> &mdash; Jenkins home directory
        <li><tt>${ITEM_ROOTDIR}</tt> &mdash; Root directory of a job for which the workspace is allocated.
        <li><tt>${ITEM_FULLNAME}</tt> &mdash; '/'-separated job name, like "foo/bar".
    </ul>

    <p>
    Changing this value allows you to put build records on a bigger but slow disk,
    while keeping JENKINS_HOME on highly available backed up drive, for example.
    Default value is <tt>${ITEM_ROOTDIR}/builds</tt>.
</div>

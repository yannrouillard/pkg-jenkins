h1. Jenkins OSX Installer Project

To create the Jenkins Installer for OSX you need an OSX machine with Developer Tools installed. You can download the Developer Tools from Apple's Developer Connection website (http://developer.apple.com)

h3. Build the installer

To build an installer you need to download the version you'd like to package from http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/war/latest/. Download the jenkins.war and place the file in *binary* directory. The installer project requires the file to be there. Otherwise the creation process will fail.

Open a terminal and enter the following commands:
<pre><code>ant build -DjenkinsBuildNumber=1.4xx</code></pre>
